# Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a neural network implementation for various machine learning tasks.

## Contents

- `neural-network.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the neural network implementation and experiments.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset used for training the neural network.
- `readme.md`: This README file.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network.git
cd neural-network/nn
```

Open the Jupyter notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook neural-network.ipynb
```

Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the neural network.

## Dataset

The training dataset `train.csv` is used to train the neural network. Make sure the dataset is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
